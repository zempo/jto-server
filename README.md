## Mission

We spend too much time finding the right greeting cards.
Imagine being able to create a greeting card -- ready to print and paste on paper -- within a minute!
Then, imagine being able to share, publish, edit, and download your own occasion.

"Just the Occasion" is built for all your moments.
